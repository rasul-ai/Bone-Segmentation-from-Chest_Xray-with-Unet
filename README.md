# Bone-Segmentation-with-Unet

In this repository I have tried to implement a segmentation model with Unet of my own. I have inspired to implement this from a paper ***MDU-Net: A Convolutional Network for Clavicle and Rib Segmentation from a Chest Radiograph*** [Link](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2020/2785464/). My code architecture is different from the architecture of the original paper. Basically, I have done this work to increase my skill in the field of deep learning.

## I have created a slide on this project. Please view the slide to know more.

### I will upload the original preprocessed dataset soon.
